"""MMH3 Ultimate Upscale - one node for the full latent re-enhancement loop.

Pipeline (auto, no graph wiring):
    input AV latent
      -> temporal split (outer loop)
      ->   latent upscale  (H3 3D upscaler, per chunk, video only)
      ->   spatial split   (inner loop)
      ->   per-tile sampling with preview
      ->   spatial stitch
      -> temporal stitch
      -> output AV latent

Helpers (frame/token mapping, re-anchoring, spatial tiling, seam blending,
stitching) are self-contained copies of the logic used by the
Comfyui-MiniMax-H3-LatentSplit project so this plugin has no dependency on it.

Frame/token mapping mirrors comfy.ldm.minimax.model:
  * video latent token k covers FRAME_PER_TOKEN[k % 5] = (1, 4, 4, 4, 4) pixel
    frames (periodic grid, 17 frames per 5 tokens)
  * audio latent frames run at FRAME_RESCALE = 5/3 per pixel frame (40 vs 24 Hz)

The H3 3D upscaler inference code (model classes, loading, normalization stats)
lives in h3_latent_upscaler.py, copied from the
Comfyui_Minimax_h3_latent_Upscaler plugin so it works with the
minimax_h3_latent_upscaler_3d checkpoints directly. The LTX2.5 block lives in
ltx.py.
